    "Self-assessment: I think the exercises went pretty well. I was struggling a little bit with the `range` in the last exercise, as I know the convention is to start the range at `0`, whereas I wanted to make it straight-forward and start it at `1`, since it would be easier to explain why I coded the way I did. My question here is: Can I assume in my notebooks that people know that the convention is to start at `0`, e.g. with the variable `lines`?"

I personally believe that this kind of median does not contain any added value about the data set.\n",

    "For the first exercise, I created a `for` loop that ranges from 1 until 10. This `for` loop keeps track of the lines, and each iteration within this loop will end with a new line being created (`print('\\n')`). In each iteration, I introduce the `star_count` variable, which keeps track of the number of stars in a certain line. Namely, the number of stars need to match the line-number in this specific pattern. The `while` loop will take of the number of stars in each line (e.g. in line 4, it will keep printing stars and adding to the `star_count` up until the point the `star_count` has value 4, and thus four stars have been printed). As soon as a certain line (so a certain iteration in the `for` loop) is done, the variable `star_count` is reset to 0, and the process repeats itself. This happens until 10 lines, with each line containing an increasing number of stars, will be printed."

This is captured by the statement `print(' ' * line,end='')`, which multiplies the space-string by the line number. Note that in the first line, we need no spaces, and therefore, we subtract 1 from the value of `line`. We could prevent this by letting `line` range over 0 until 10, but for convenience, we choose the value of `line` to be the same as the line-number. Finally, we print the right number of stars in each line by initializing `star_count` to be equal to 11 and letting the value of `star_count` decrease up until we have the right amount of stars in each line (e.g. in the first `line`, we get `11 - 1` stars)."
